# Badges

## Must have (order to be specified)

- [license](https://shields.io/category/license) (it is sth people check first if they want to use repository)
- [build status](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#adding-a-workflow-status-badge-to-your-repository) (says if current code is working at all, depends on build service)
- [last commit](https://shields.io/category/activity) (to inform when last update was done)
- [dependencies](https://david-dm.org/) (to show that we care about our repos and update them as needed)
- [contributors](./contributors.md) (will be added and updated automatically by "all-contributors" bot)
- [code coverage](./code-coverage.md) (says about test existence and code quality)
- [code quality](./code-quality.md)
- [Security analysis](./security.md)

[Any others?](https://shields.io/)

## For NPM modules

Should we duplicate github info that is seen above on page?

Which page is more important Github or NPM?

Some information (badges) can be taken from NPM to Github readme and some Github information can be added from Github.

The problem is duplicated information that can be seen on Github and NPM - to be clarified.
